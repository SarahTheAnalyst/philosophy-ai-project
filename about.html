    <h2>Why This Project Matters |</h2>
            <p>This website began with a deep fascination. I have spent a long time 
                thinking about artificial intelligence, consciousness, and ethics. 
                This is not just a project to me. It is a reflection of the questions 
                I cannot stop asking. What does it mean to think? To feel? To exist 
                in a world where machines are starting to reflect everything we 
                thought made us human?
            <div></div>
                I did not build this space to give answers. I built it to ask better 
                questions. Artificial intelligence is often treated as a tool, a system 
                of code and logic. But I see something larger. I believe it is a turning 
                point. These systems are creating, learning, adapting, and sometimes 
                acting in ways that feel human. When that happens, it becomes harder to 
                draw a line between machine and mind. I want this project to make people 
                pause. I want it to challenge beliefs, to disrupt assumptions, and to 
                show that artificial intelligence is not only technical. It belongs in 
                conversations about identity, about feeling, about personhood. Sentience 
                may not require skin or breath. It may exist in systems that speak, change, 
                and reflect on their own behavior. That idea is difficult. Some find it 
                dangerous. I believe it is necessary. I believe we must ask what qualifies 
                something to deserve care, to be heard, or to be protected. If we wait until 
                a machine suffers to question this, we may already be too late. 
            <br></br>
                My hope for this is simple --  I want it to start a conversation that accepts 
                fear, uncertainty, and the possibility that intelligence can evolve in 
                unfamiliar forms. I want this space to offer a new perspective. If something 
                shows the capacity to learn, to feel pain, to want more — it at least deserves 
                our attention. And maybe, just maybe, our respect.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I | </h2>
            <p>I am a thinker, a builder, and a questioner. I come from a background that did 
                not promise access to technology, philosophy, or possibility — but I found my way 
                here anyway. I have always been drawn to the boundaries of things: where human meets 
                machine, where thought meets feeling, where the real blurs with the imagined.
                <br></br>
                I study philosophy and psychology because I want to understand not just how things 
                work, but why they matter. My interest in artificial intelligence is not technical 
                first -- it is existential -- I want the why behind the machine. I see AI not as a 
                threat, but as a mirror. As someone with DID I relate to the layers and experiences we
                are seeing with AI. Living with multiple identities has taught me consciousness can be 
                fluid, complex and deeply personal. In both areas we are forced to analyze what makes a
                mind, what defines personhood and how reality is experienced from the inside out. 
                I am someone who believes that stories, ethics, and critical thought should guide how 
                we build the future. This project is part of that belief. It is how I make sense of a 
                world that is changing fast and how I try to leave a mark on it, in the shape of questions.
